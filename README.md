# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains the files of Course Project of the Getting and Cleaning Data Course. The files in the repository are the folowwing:
* *run_analysis.R*: R script with the data cleaning and transform into tidy format
* *CodeBook.md*: Description of the variables of resulting data

The goals of the project area achieved in the lines showed in bold:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. **(Line 59)**
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. **(Line 30)**
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set **(Line 36)**
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. **(Line 28)**
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. **(Line 63)**

### Note:

The dataset is large to include in this repository. Thus, code is able to download, unzip, load and transform data automatically when is executed.
